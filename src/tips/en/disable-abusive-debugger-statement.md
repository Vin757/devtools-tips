title: Disable abusive debugger statements that prevent inspecting websites

Some websites make it impossible to use DevTools by adding `debugger` statements in their code.

The statements don't do anything for normal users, but as soon as DevTools is opened, the JavaScript execution pauses, and this makes it impossible to debug or inspect the site as normal.

To disable the abusive `debugger` statement:

## In Firefox, Chrome, and Edge

* Open the **Sources** tool (or **Debugger** tool in Firefox).
* Right-click the line number gutter, right next to the `debugger` statement.
* Either click **Never pause here**.
* Or create a new **Conditional breakpoint**, and enter `false` as the condition for this breakpoint.
* Refresh the page.

Now, everytime this line of code is executed, the nasty `debugger` statement will be ignored and the page will run normally!

Thank you [Fran√ßois for the tweet](https://twitter.com/quicksave2k/status/1610250172210073607) and [Pankaj Parashar for the tip about using the **Never pause here** option](https://github.com/captainbrosset/devtools-tips/issues/66).

## In Safari

* Open the **Sources** tool.
* At the top left of the tool, in the list of breakpoints, click the arrow next to **Debugger Statements**.

Any further `debugger` statement will be ignored.
