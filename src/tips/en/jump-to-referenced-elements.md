title: Jump from a label `for` attribute to the linked input (and more)

In Firefox and Polypane you can jump from an element that references the ID attribute of an other element, to that other element, by <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+clicking (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+clicking) the attribute or in Polypane by just clicking the attribute.

Here is a common example for when this is useful:

```html
<label for="foo">Label</label>
...
<input id="foo">
```

In the above example, clicking the `foo` attribute value in the `label` element (while holding the <kbd>Cmd</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key) will jump to the `input` element and select it. This can be very useful if the elements are far apart in the DOM tree.

Note that this also works for other kinds of "links" like:

* `<button form="formID">`
* `<input list="datalistID">`
* `<td headers="header1ID,header2ID">`
